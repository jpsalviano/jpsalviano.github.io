## Thanks for checking out this README!

**GitHub pages** is a fine tool for beginner developers. You guys need to show off your skills otherwise no one will notice you. Now I'm taking that advice and applying to my own life. Very often we treat others better than we treat ourselves, but this is not gonna be my case anymore. Hope you all do the same 😄

So, in the next days I'm gonna develop a nice looking static page linking visitors to my professional contact info and some stuff I write on Notion.os.

Suggestions? Reach me at my twitter @jpsalviano (DMs only). 

Peace!
